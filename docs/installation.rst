Enabling tab completion
-----------------------

Raiden client can be configured to auto complete commands when the <tab> key
is pressed.

After installing raiden-client, to activate tab-completion in future bash
prompts, use::

    register-python-argcomplete raiden-client >> ~/.bashrc


For one-time activation of argcomplete for raiden-client, use::

    eval "$(register-python-argcomplete raiden-client)"
